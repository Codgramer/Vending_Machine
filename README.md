# Vending_Machine
OOPS


This project is an implementation that combines object-oriented programming and data structures to simulate a real-world vending machine system. It uses vectors to store and manage the list of products and unordered maps to keep track of the items in the cart, ensuring efficient operations. The system supports adding new products, updating stock, viewing the cart, and checking out. File I/O operations are employed to read product data from a file and update inventory and profit records. The project showcases the practical application of OOP principles and DSA techniques in building a functional and interactive vending machine simulation.
